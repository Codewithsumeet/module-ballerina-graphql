# News Alert System

## Introduction

This example shows an implementation of a news alert system using Ballerina. The service is exposed as a GraphQL service. Internally, it uses Kafka to handle real-time updates.

The service has all three GraphQL root types: `Query`, `Mutation`, and `Subscription`.

1. `Query` Type

2. `Mutation` Type

3. `Subscription` Type

Following is the schema of the GraphQL service. This will be auto-generated by the Ballerina GraphQL engine.

```graphql
type Query {
    users: [User!]!
    publishers: [Publisher!]!
}

type Mutation {
    publish(update: NewsUpdate!): News!
    registerUser(newUser: NewUser!): User!
    registerPublisher(newPublisher: NewPublisher!): Publisher!
}

type Subscription {
    news(userId: String!): News!
}

type User {
    id: String!
    name: String!
    age: Int!
}

type Publisher {
    id: String!
    name: String!
    agency: Agency!
}

type NewsUpdate {
    headline: String!
    brief: String!
    content: String!
    publisherId: String!
}

type NewUser {
    name: String!
    age: Int!
}

type NewPublisher {
    name: String!
    agency: Agency!
}

type News {
    id: String!
    headline: String!
    brief: String!
    content: String!
    publisher: Publisher!
}

enum Agency {
    CBC
    BNN
    FIRST_NEWS
}
```
