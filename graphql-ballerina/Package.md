# Package Overview

The GraphQL library is one of the standard library packages of the<a target="_blank" href="https://ballerina.io/"> Ballerina </a> language.

This package provides support for implementing a GraphQL service using the Ballerina. GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language for APIs. 
Unlike the REST APIs, GraphQL provides a way to clients to request exactly what they want, and the GraphQL server only sends the requested data, by defining a structure of the data, which will prevent from returning excessively larger amounts of data.
