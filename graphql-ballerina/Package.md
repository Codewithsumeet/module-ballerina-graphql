# Package Overview

The `graphql` library is one of the standard library packages of the <a target="_blank" href="https://ballerina.io/">Ballerina</a> language.

This package provides support for implementing a GraphQL service using Ballerina. GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language for APIs. 
Unlike the REST APIs, GraphQL provides a way for clients to request exactly what they want and the GraphQL server only sends the requested data by defining a structure of the data, which will prevent from returning excessively larger amounts of data.
